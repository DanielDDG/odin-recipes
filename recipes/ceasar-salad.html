  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Salad of romaine lettuce tossed with an olive oil dressing, a coddled or raw egg, garlic, and 
  grated cheese and topped with croutons and sometimes anchovies. The salad's creation is generally 
  attributed to the restaurateur Caesar Cardini, an Italian immigrant who operated restaurants in 
  Mexico and the United States.</p>

  <p>As the salad moved North to the U.S, a key ingredient changed within the recipe. Lemon juice is 
  commonly used, despite the original Caesar salad opting for lime. It is thought the confusion came 
  from the word for 'lime' in Mexican Spanish being 'lim√≥n', which sounds like 'lemon'.</p>
