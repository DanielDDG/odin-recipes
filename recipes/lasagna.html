  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Lasagna noodles need structure, especially because they have a lot of ingredients 
  layered between them! You don't want to make 'em too mushy, which can be easy to do 
  accidentally because they're cooked twice: once in the boiling water, and once in the 
  oven. Make sure to cook them until they're very al dente in the boiling stage:</p>

  <p>They're ready typically 2 to 4 minutes before the amount of time on the box! Don't 
  listen to the box of lies and look instead for the thin white line in the middle of your
  noodle when you go in to take a little test nibble.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
