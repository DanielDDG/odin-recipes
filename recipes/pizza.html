  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Make sure that you have preheated the oven. In case you are using a standard oven then 
  make sure it’s preheated at 280 degree Celsius. In case you are using a readymade base, 
  make sure it’s not cold. Make sure that you take it out half an hour before you start making 
  the pizza.</p>

  <p>Don’t roll the dough, stretch it to make the base. This means if you are making the fresh 
  pizza base, the dough will be at room temperature and it would be easy to stretch it. The best 
  way to make restaurant-style pizza is to use a pizza stone, as it helps the dough in rising and 
  makes it crisp as well. Go for it.</p>
